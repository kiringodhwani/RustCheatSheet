## Cargo
**<u>cargo</u>** = build system, package manager, important for managing dependencies (this is a pain point with other low-level programming languages so it is really nice that rust has it built in).

- **TO compile a project, installs dependencies and necessary things for the dependency:** `cargo build`. When you add dependencies, like in the below example, you have to run `cargo build`...

    [package]
    name = "guessing_game"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"

    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.5.5"  // added this dependency

- **TO make new project**: cargo new {project_name}

- **TO check code for errors without producing an executable:** cargo check

- **TO compile (if necessary) and run project:** cargo run
