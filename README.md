# Cargo
**cargo** = build system, package manager, important for managing dependencies (this is a pain point with other low-level programming languages so it is really nice that rust has it built in).

- **TO compile a project, installs dependencies and necessary things for the dependency:** `cargo build`. When you add dependencies, like in the below example, you have to run `cargo build`...

    [package]
    name = "guessing_game"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"

    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.5.5"  // added this dependency

- **TO make new project**: cargo new {project_name}

- **TO check code for errors without producing an executable:** cargo check

- **TO compile (if necessary) and run project:** cargo run

# Guessing Game

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1, 101);

    println!("The secret number is {}", secret_number);

    loop{
        println!("Please enter a number: ");

        // In rust, variables are immutable by default. 'mut' makes it mutable.
        //
        // new() returns an empty string we can use.
        //
        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin()
            // No named parameters in rust so type in value then "param_name:" shows up.
            //

            // read_line takes in the user's input and appends it to the specified buffer.
            // We specify the buffer to be guess (which is initialized to '').
            // Specify the buffer as a mutable reference (here, to the guess string), so
            // it takes a reference to the guess string and modifies it without taking
            // ownership of it. Returns a result type that either returns 'Ok' holding
            // the return value (i.e., user input) or 'Err' holding an error object.
            //
            .read_line(&mut guess)

            // If an error is returned, probably a system error. If Ok is returned, then expect
            // returns the value stored in Ok. Otherwise panic with an error message.
            .expect("Failed to read line");

        // Convert user's input from String to unsigned 32-bit int
        // let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number as your guess");

        // Smarter way to convert user's input from String to unsigned 32-bit int
        // that also handles invalid input:
        //
        // let guess: u32 = ... - declares a variable of type u32
        //
        // guess.trim().parse() - takes string guess, removes whitespace, parse to #.
        //
        // parse() returns a Result enum, which is either:
        //      Ok(value) if parsing succeeded
        //      Err(error) if parsing failed
        //
        // match allows us to handle different cases based on the result:
        //     If parsing is successful (Ok(num)), it assigns the parsed number to guess
        //
        //     If parsing fails (Err(_)), the underscore means "ignore the specific error" 
        //          and continue skips to the next iteration of a loop
        //
        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(val) => val, 
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("{}", "Your guess was too small!".red()),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("{}", "Your guess was too large!".red()),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("{}", "Your guess was correct!".green());
                break; // break the loop if they guess the number correctly
            }
        }
    }

}

```

# Variables

- **Variables in Rust are immutable by default**. You have to specify "mut" to make mutable.

```Rust
let mut x = 5;    // make `x` mutable with `mut`

println!("This is the value of my variable: {}", x);

x = 6;     // we can reassign `x` bc we marked it as mutable
println!("This is the new value of my variable after reassignment: {}", x);
```

## Constants
- Compared to immutable variables, **constants can't be made mutable with "mut"**.
- Define constants with all upper case and underscores for spaces
- Also, they have to be type annotated, like the 'u32' specified below.

```Rust
const SUBSCRIBER_COUNT: u32 = 1000;
```
- NOTE: **Constants can ONLY be set to constant expressions**, e.g., can't be set to return value of function or any value that's computed at runtime.

# Data Types

## Scalar Data Types

### Integers
- **i32** = signed 32-bit integer (signed = can be positive or negative)
- **u32** = unsigned 32-bit integer (unsigned = can only be positive)
```Rust
let a = 98332;
let b = 98_332;    // '_' is a visual separator, like a comma, so `b` is same as `a`
println!("My value: {}", b);

let f: u8 = 256; // this value is to big for u8 --> get error about overflow
```

### Floating-point Numbers
```Rust
let f = 5.0;

let sum = 5 + 10;
let difference = 98.3 - 4.2;
let product = 4 * 30;
let quotient = 9.3 / 2.9;
let remainder = 99 / 5;
```

### Booleans
```Rust
let t = true;
let f = false;
```

### Character (use single quotes)
```Rust
let c = 'k';
```


## Compound Data Types

### Tuple (0-indexed)
```Rust
let tup = ("kirin", 23);
let (name, age) = tup;     // destructing to access tuple values
let name = tup.0;          // dot notation to access tuple values
let age = tup.1;
```

### Array (0-indexed, fixed length)
```Rust
let error_codes = [200, 404, 500];
let not_found = error_codes[1];     // 404

let byte = [0; 8];     // create an array with 8 values all set to 0
```

---

# Functions
- The **naming convention** for functions in Rust is **all lowercase and underscores for spaces**.
- **Have to specify return type**, e.g., "-> i32".

```Rust
fn my_function(name: &str, age: i32, in_x_years: i32) -> i32{
    println!("{} is {} years old!", name, age);

    // By default, the last line in a function is returned and
    // doesn't require a semicolon. So, can replace the below...
    // let sum = age + in_x_years;
    // return sum
    age + in_x_years
}

fn main() {
    // Call the function in `main`
    let sum = my_function("Kirin", 23, 5);

    println!("In five years, he will be {}", sum)
}
```

---

# Control Flow

## If statements

- **Conditions** in the if statement must **explicitly** be **booleans**

```Rust
let number = 5;

// conditions in the if statement must explicitly be booleans
if number < 10 {
    println!("number is less than 10");
} else if number > 10 {
    println!("number is greater than 10");
} else {
    println!("number is equal to 10")
}
```

## Loops

### `loop`

- execute the code in the loop over and over again until we call 'break'

```Rust
loop {
    println!("again!");
    break;
}
```

- You can use `loop` to return a value...

```Rust
let mut counter = 0;
let result = loop {
    counter += 1;
    if counter == 10 {
        break counter;    // This returns `counter` when the loop breaks.
                          // Value is stored in `result`.
    }
};
println!("{}", result)
```

### `while`
```Rust
let mut number = 3;
while number != 0 {
    println!("{}", number);
    number -= 1;
}
println!("LIFTOFF!!!")
```

### `for`
```Rust
let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
for element in a.iter() {
    println!("{}", element);
}

// Just like Python range(), `..` doesn't include the upper bound unless you use `..=`
for number in 1..4 {        
    println!{"{}", number};
}
```
